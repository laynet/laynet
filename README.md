## About Me:
I'm a self-taught Software Engineer with a BA degree and Full-Stack Development bootcamp completion in 2020. Experienced in building high-performing web applications for Small Businesses in E-Commerce, Alternative Medicine, and Finance. At Breakout Studio, I developed Tryp Therapeuticsâ€™ digital presence from 0 to 1, earning the Graphic Design USA Digital Design Award (2022). I'm currently upskilling at Formation, a competitive and highly selective engineering fellowship working alongside software engineers from top companies to learn best engineering practices. 

In my free time I enjoy organic and sustainable gardening. I'm deeply passionate about native plants and aside from the food that I grow, my garden is all native, baby! I also took great pleasure in researching and then building a native wild life pond in my yard. I also love crocheting, playing video games, reading and doing yoga. I received my 200 YTT in 2009 and I volunteer my time to teach a donation based inclusive, body neutral yoga class a few times a month.
